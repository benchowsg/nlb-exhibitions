    section-description:  On Paper: Singapore Before 1867 features over 150 paper-based artefacts that tell the story of Singapore’s early history – from a 17th-century Portuguese navigational chart that points to the existence of a Shahbandar (harbour master) on Singapore island to the key document that established the Straits Settlements as a Crown Colony of Britain on 1 April 1867.
